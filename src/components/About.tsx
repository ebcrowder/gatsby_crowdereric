        I am a full-stack web developer based in sunny Portland, Oregon. In
        particular, I really enjoy working with various JavaScript libraries and
        runtimes such as React.js and Node.js. I believe in immersing myself
        fully in life and thereby fully enjoying the process, whether it be work
        or personal endeavors.

        When not coding, I am an avid trail runner and spend a lot of time
        running in gorgeous Forest Park. I love being a part of the trail
        running community here in the Pacific Northwest and enjoy exploring the
        many trails located in Oregon and Washington. I also really enjoy hiking
        and camping.
