        I am a web developer based in sunny Portland, Oregon. As a developer, I
        really enjoy collaborating with teams to solve difficult problems. In my
        spare time, I enjoy working on projects that align with my values and
        stretch my abilities.
      </p>

        When not building internet things indoors, I spend a lot of time running
        in gorgeous Forest Park. I love being a part of the trail running
        community here in the Pacific Northwest and enjoy exploring the many
        trails located in Oregon and Washington. I also really enjoy cycling,
        hiking and camping.
